There we go, my new project page for 1DV022 is now up and running!
It runs on Jekyll and SASS - which means that it's generated by a static site generator, and css preprocessor.

## A new beginning

This marks a first for me, since I've never developed websites with this method before - and I'm really excited to dive deeper in this to expand my knowledge. 
Since before, I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, PHP, relational databases (mainly sql), JavaScript and Java. Responsive & dynamic webdesign and object oriented programming, put in short. Feels good adding more to that list and learning a bunch of new stuff.

#### Another timeline

Another project I worked on recently, also anchored in my studies at [UDM-Linnéuniversitetet][udm-devops], is [Hajtek][hajtek] - a Swedish gaming community. This site has been developed through different incarnations over the last couple of years. Now, with my latest design, it feels like we hit a sweetspot. The future holds more development on the current platform, to implement our own community solution with member functionality and a cool forum. Looking forward to continue work on that when time permits.

For now, though, let's explore all the cool things we can do with Jekyll and SASS!
