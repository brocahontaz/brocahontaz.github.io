I started out as a self taught web developer in my wee youth, hungrily learning and honing my skills. HTML was the first "programming" language I stumbled upon, and started making my own
fansites for sports teams and such. Soon, I also discovered CSS and began to explore the many options it provided for styling my sites.

Fast forward some years, I wanted to be able to build more complex website structures. I wanted dynamic content. And so, I was introduced to PHP and MySQL. Never a real fan of just using 
finished frameworks (like for example phpBB) to modify, I set out to learn how to build everything from scratch by myself.

More recently, the last couple of years I have run a project called [Hajtek][hajtek] - which have turned into somewhat of a development platform for myself.  With Hajtek, I constantly try to better myself, 
and implement new functionality that I gain knowledge of. At the moment, I am building a community framework from scratch. In a hopefully near future, I hope to release Hajtek with this framework. For now, Hajtek acts as an information hub for the Swedish gaming community that it is.

With computers and IT being one of my main interests for years, I decided it was this I wanted to build a career upon. To get an even more professional approach, and learn all the stuff you miss out on being self taught, it was time to get a degree. 2013 I started my studies at LTH, Lund. Here, I studied Information and Communication Technology for little over 2 years as part of an engineering program. During those years, I realized that I wanted to specialize myself more towards the software developing part, and had less interest in the other parts of being an "engineer". As the engineering programs have a broader scope of subjects, I felt the need to change direction - and change my studies. 

I am currently studying at Linnéuniversitetet to be a [devop][udm-devops]. Here, I finally found the perfect fit for me.

### Skills

##### Web developing

I have worked extensively with HTML and CSS while making website layouts for several of years. Adding to that, I also have knowledge in PHP and relational databases such as (My)SQL.

Lately, I have been using JavaScript and jQuery more frequently. Partly thanks to also taking courses in it. This allows me to further enhance the experience of sites I build.

All in all, I can provide a fully dynamic and responsive website.

##### Software developing
As of now, the main programming language I have studied and used is Java. With Java, the focus have been on learning and implementing object oriented programming.

### Studies
In the past, I have studied a bunch of courses at LTH in Lund. This includes object oriented programming with mainly Java, relational databases and computer security.

At the moment, I am attending my first year at Linnéuniversitetet studying to be a [devop][udm-devops]. What is a devop, you might ask? Devop is short for developer/operator, and this means
that I am studying to be a software developer - but also an operator. Someone who can both develop software, and then administrate it. And that, that is just what I like.

### This site
Rooter.se is built as part of the course Clientbased webprogramming during my studies at Linnéuniversitetet. It is built with static site processing and css preprocessing through Jekyll and Sass.

The theme and content is custom made by myself.

HTML5, CSS3 and some simple JQuery scripts have been used to make this my new home.

This site is made fully responsive for all modern devices- something I implement with all of my work.
